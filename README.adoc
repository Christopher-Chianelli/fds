fds strives to be the most impractical data structure libary in existance.
All data structures in fds use files to store their data.

Pull requests are accepted - feel free to add your own horrendous data 
structures to it; however, we will not accept PR that add an efficient data
structure. If you add a data structure, it must use files, and cannot store
data in an array except inside functions.
